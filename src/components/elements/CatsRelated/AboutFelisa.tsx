                    <p>
                        Cats have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.
                        Growing up with these majestic creatures, I realized that their
                        loyalty and love for their owners are unmatched. Felissa is a place
                        where I share my passion for cats and help them find loving homes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our mission is to rescue cats and provide them with the care they

                        find their forever home.
